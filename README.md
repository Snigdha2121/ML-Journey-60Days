# 🚀 ML-Journey-60Days

Welcome to my **60-Day Machine Learning Challenge!** 🎯
This repository documents my daily learning journey in Machine Learning through hands-on projects. Each day, I'll explore a new ML concept, summarize my learnings, and implement a small project to apply the theory.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each day has its own folder:
```
ML-Journey-60Days/
│── DAY_01/
│   ├── README.md  # Summary of what I learned on Day 1
│   ├── project/    # Contains the project files for the day
│── DAY_02/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── project/
│...
│── DAY_60/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── project/
│── handwritten_notes/  # Contains the entire handwritten notes of my journey
```

## 🏆 Challenge Goal
- Learn **Machine Learning** by applying concepts to real-world projects.
- Gain practical experience with **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and more**.
- Document my progress to reinforce learning and share knowledge.

## 🔥 Daily Learning Plan
- **📖 Learn:** Read or watch content on the day's ML topic.
- **✍️ Document:** Write a concise summary in `README.md`.
- **💻 Build:** Implement a small project to apply the concept.
- **🚀 Share:** Commit my progress to GitHub.

## 🎓 Learning Resource
I am following the Udemy course:
