# 📅 Day 01 - Introduction to Machine Learning & Data Preprocessing

## 📖 What I Learned

### 🔹 What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a process by which we train computers to mimic artificial intelligence. It enables systems to learn from historical data and make real-time decisions without explicit programming.

### 🔹 The Machine Learning Process
Machine learning consists of three key steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing** - Exploring, cleaning, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. **Modeling** - Building the model, training it, and making predictions.
3. **Evaluation** - Measuring model performance using performance metrics.

### 🔹 Training vs. Testing Data
- **Training Set**: A portion of the dataset used to teach the ML model.
- **Testing Set**: A separate portion of data used to evaluate the model's performance.
- **Typical Splits**: 80% training, 20% testing (sometimes 70%-30%, depending on dataset size and type).

### 🔹 Feature Scaling
Feature scaling is a technique used to standardize the range of independent variables or features in a dataset.

#### **Two Methods of Feature Scaling:**
1. **Normalization (Min-Max Scaling)**
   - Rescales values to a range between 0 and 1.
     
2. **Standardization (Z-score Normalization)**
   - Rescales values to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

⚠️ **Important Note:** Feature scaling is always applied to **columns** (features), not rows (individual data points).
